Small modpack as a take on Mianite season 2 in modern minecraft, mainly for my own personal/social use but if you'd like to give it a try, go ahead!

This mod is focused around using magic, exploring and technology. Back when Mianite Season 2 first came out, there was a lot of new mods in minecraft and the world was a very different place but now using modern minecraft and a lot of the same mods alongside some newer mods or mods that function the same way, recreate the enjoyment from the second season of Mianite all the way ahead in 1.19.2!

Features:

Exploration: Explore the world as never before with help from mods such as Twilight Forest, Biomes O' Plenty and various other exploration impacting mods.
Mekanism: Integrate high-tech machinery for energy generation, resource processing, and advanced automation.
Tinkers Construct: Experience using Tinkers Construct to make fun, powerful or just awesome looking weapons, armor and tools to take with you on your journey!
Extreme Reactors: Never struggle for power again with the help of Extreme reactors.
Thermal Series: Utilize a variety of machines and tools to enhance resource processing and automation.
Magic Focus: Play around with numerous magic mods and see the world of minecraft in a new light using mods such as Ars Nouveau, Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks, Apotheosis, Mystical Agriculture and Theurgy.
