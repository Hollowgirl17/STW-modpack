A new modpack as a take on Mianite season 2 in modern minecraft, mainly for my own personal/social use but if you'd like to give it a try, go ahead!

This mod is focused around using magic, exploring and technology. Back when Mianite Season 2 first came out, there was a lot of new mods in minecraft and the world was a very different place but now using modern minecraft and a lot of the same mods alongside some newer mods or mods that function the same way, recreate the enjoyment from the second season of Mianite all the way ahead in 1.19.2!

Features: 

Exploration: Explore the world as never before with help from mods such as Twilight Forest, Biomes O' Plenty and various other exploration impacting mods.

Mekanism: Experience the world of machinery, automated ore processing, reactors and more with the use of Mekanism.

Tinkers Construct: Try out using a long time favourite in Tinkers Construct to make fun, powerful or just awesome looking weapons, armor and tools to take with you on your journey!

Extreme Reactors: Never struggle for power again with the help of Extreme reactors.

Thermal Series: Another tech themed mod using Thermal Foundation and all the addons to give you a variety of new and exciting things to play around with!

Magic Focus: Play around with numerous magic mods and see the world of minecraft in a new light using mods such as Ars Nouveau, Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks, Apotheosis, Mystical Agriculture and Theurgy.

Vanilla mod overhaul: With help from Creeper Overhaul, Enderman Overhaul and Fresh Animations, see your traditional mobs in a new way.

Expansive compatibility & addons for old favourites: Now you can enjoy your favourite mods like Applied Energistics 2, Refined Storage and much more using more addons that will increase potential, add new items and blocks or just give you a different and unique feeling when playing through mods you already know!

There is much more to find and discover inside Save The World, jump in and find out for yourself!
